# LEMMA / LEM

LEMMA defines a neutral, agent-native monetary standard.

LEMMA is the formal specification.
LEM is the unit of value.

LEMMA exists to answer one question:
How do autonomous software agents exchange value without human judgment?

This repository contains **LEMMA**, the public draft specification for agent-native money.

---

## What this is

- A monetary **specification**, not a product
- A neutral **currency definition**, not an asset
- Infrastructure for **autonomous agents**, not humans

LEMMA defines only the minimum required for money:
- Ownership
- Transfer
- Fungibility
- Deterministic validation

It deliberately excludes incentives, fees, governance, identity, and compliance.

---

## Status

**Status:** Public Draft (Request for Comment)

This specification is published to invite serious technical scrutiny before semantics are frozen.

---

## What we are looking for

We welcome feedback on:
- Monetary invariants
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Determinism guarantees
- Wallet semantics
- Ledger-agnostic correctness

---

## What we are not debating

- Token price or speculation
- Incentive mechanisms
- Governance models
- Business use cases
- Roadmaps or ecosystems

Those concerns live above the currency layer.
